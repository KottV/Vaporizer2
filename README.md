"PROBABLY THE MOST VERSATILE WAVETABLE SYNTHESIZER"  
Vaporizer2 is a hybrid wavetable additive / subtractive VST / AU / AAX synthesizer / sampler workstation.  

The heart of this plugin is the alias-free versatile high-performance wavetable sound engine with low system CPU resource usage.  

Vaporizer2 comes with a groundbreaking wavetable editor with a vast number of editing possibilities including frequency shift, smooth, clean, bend and bloat for single-cycles, parts of single-cycles or even whole wavetables.
Featuring an easy-to use wavetable draw mode with smooth Bezier curves and snap to grid function.

Available formats: VST2 / VST3 / AU / AAX plugins and a standalone version for both macOS and Windows.

* Vaporizer2 was developed by VAST Dynamics GbR between 2017 and 2023 and is now free software under GPL3 license.  
* Vaporizer2 is based on the [JUCE framework](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) under GPL3 license.  
* Vaporizer2 ueses [muFFT](https://github.com/Themaister/muFFT/tree/master) under GPL2 license.
* You need a (free) developer license from [Steinberg](https://www.steinberg.net/de/developers/) to use the VST2 SDK (to build a .vst instead of .vst3).  In that case put the SDK in the VST_SDK folder.
* You need a (free) ASIO SDK 2.3 installation from [Steinberg](https://www.steinberg.net/de/developers/). Place it in the asiosdk folder.  
* You need a (free) developer license from [Avid Technology](http://developer.avid.com/aax/) to use the AAX SDK (to build an AAX plugin for ProTools). In that case put the SDK in the AAX_SDK folder. The compiled AAXLibrary_x64.lib is expected here C:\Vaporizer2\AAX_SDK\AAX_SDK_2p3p2\AAX_SDK_2p3p2\Libs\Release\AAXLibrary_x64.lib. You can change the folder in the global path settings of the Projucer.
* Code signing is required to build an AAX or an AU on MacOS. The process is not described here.
* To the best of our knowledge the true type fonts in [VASTvaporizer/Resources/Fonts/](VASTvaporizer/Resources/Fonts/) are freeware and can be distributed.

## Preparation
### 1. Windows
  - The project expects to find the repository structure in c:\Vaporizer2\
    Use
    `mklink /h /J "C:\Vaporizer2" [lokal repository path]`
    to symlink if needed.   
  - Run Projucer.exe as admininistrator.
    
### 2. macOS
  - Build Projucer from JUCE/extras/Projucer/Builds/MacOSX/Projucer.xcodeproj
  - Run Projucer
  - Set Global Paths from Menu Projucer>Global Paths.
  - Set path to JUCE, JUCE modules, VST SDK, AAX SDK
